# Python If-Else

Given an integer,_n_ , perform the following conditional actions:
- If _n_ is odd, print Weird
- If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of _2_ to _5_, print Not Weird
- If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of _6_ to _20_, print Weird
- If _n_ is even and greater than _20_, print Not Weird

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, _n_.
- 1<= _n_ <=100

## Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

## Sample Input 0
```3```

## Sample Output 0
```Weird```

## Explaination 0
_n_ = 3
_n_ is odd number and odd numbers are weird. so print **weird**
