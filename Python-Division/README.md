# Python: Division
The provided code stub reads two integers, _a_ and _b_, from STDIN.\

Add logic to print two lines. \
The first line should contain the result of integer division, _a_//_b_. \
The second line should contain the result of float division, _a_ / _b_.\

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

## Example
_a_=3 \
_b_=5 \
- The result of the integer division 3//5=0. \
- The result of the float division is 3/5=0.6. \
Print:
```
0
0.6
```
## Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, _a_. \
The second line contains the second integer, _b_. \

## Output Format

Print the two lines as described above. \
